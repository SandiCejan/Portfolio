            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <h5>Main</h5>
            <p>This game was created as a graduation project at the School center in Nova Gorica. The game was created in Unity using the programming language C#, for the multiplayer mode I used the plugin Photon Networking.</p>
            <h5>Game Modes</h5>
            <p>The game has 5 game modes: Battle Royale, Kill Rush, Deathmatch, Hide & Seek and Training. In Battle Royale each player has 1 life, the last one standing wins. The main goal in Kill Rush is to reach as many kills as you can, when someone reaches
                the preset number of kills they win. To win in Deathmatch, you just need to stay alive. In the game mode Hide & Seek, a killer is assigned and only he has a gun, while others do not have anything. They need to hide and stay alive before
                the timer runs out. If the killer kills all the playes, he wins. If players stay alive till the timer runs out, they win. In training, you can just chill and practice your skills.</p>
            <h5>Legends</h5>
            <p>Legends were taken from real life professors (please note, that I don't have any malicious intent to them or to anyone). There are 4 legends in this game: Bojana, Erik, Goran and Miran. Every legend has their own unique power, based on the
                subject they teach. Bojana throws a book and it explodes like a bomb. Erik hacks the game and becomes invisible for the next 15 seconds. Goran puts on his Electromagnetic pulse hat and hurts anybody near him for the next 7 seconds. Miran
                stabs himself with an needle and becomes much faster for the next few seconds.</p>
            <h5>Customization</h5>
            <p>The game has even a customization system, you can customize the sound that plays in the menu, and the charms on the guns.</p>
            <h5>Equipment</h5>
            <p>The game has 2 guns so far: a pistol: a single fire weapon, 18 damage per bullet, maximum ammo in magazine is 15, reload time is 1 second, and a rifle: auto weapon, 14 damage per bullet, maximum ammo in magazine is 20, reload time is 2 seconds
                and fire rate is 10 bullets per second.</p>
            <h5>Map</h5>
            <p>The map takes place in school and it has 4 sections: center, classroom, gym and a dining room. In the center, there is a power recharger, the classroom and the gym have portals, to quickly go from one place to another. There are also 3 interactable
                objects: a basketball, a faucet and chairs in one of the classrooms.</p>
