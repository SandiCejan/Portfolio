            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <h5>Main</h5>
            <p>This game was created for a faculty assignment in Ljubljana. The game was created using Monogame and
                programming language C#.</p>
            <h5>Labyrinth</h5>
            <p>The maze is autogenerated, with the inputs of seed, width and height. Seed is controlling all random
                actions, such as positioning the player, monsters, doors and keys and selecting walls to close.</p>
            <h5>Game Modes</h5>
            <p>The game has 2 game modes: Escape the maze and Kill the boss. In Escape the maze, you need to get the
                keycard and escape the maze via doors, found somewhere at the edge of the map. In kill the boss, you
                need to find the boss and kill it by timing it right and trapping it inside the closing wall. There is also
                story mode, containing 7 mazes and conversations.</p>
            <h5>Monsters</h5>
            <p>There are 3 different monsters. All of them walk around normally until they see the player. That's when
                they start hunting, and their speed is accelerated. When they get to the point where they last saw the
                player, they start to randomly choose the path in the maze for 5 seconds, then start walking again.
                Normal or base monster just follows the player, damages him to the touch, shooting monster shoots at the
                player, when the player hides, it begins to follow him. Then there is the boss, that one follows the
                player, damages with touch, and leaves behind bombs that explode at the touch or after 10 seconds. It is
                also much faster.</p>
            <h5>Technical details</h5>
            <p>I am using ASP.NET API for global leaderboard, implemented many optimization methods, such as
                optimization for collision detection (each moving element is checking approximatelly 16 nearest objects)
                and rendering (rendering only visible objects). Game engine is also very robust, allowing other games to
                be built with it.</p>
